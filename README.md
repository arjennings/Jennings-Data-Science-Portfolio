# Jennings-Data-Science-Portfolio

The purpose of this repository is to store my past and present projects from my Data Science classes at Notre Dame. 
My projects are be organized in folders based on assignment. I began with more basic classwork, and throughout the course of the semester made a supervise and unsupervised ML app on Streamlit. My portfolio updates reflect an increase in challenge and complexity as my skills and knowledge grew this Spring.

I just finished a project on unsupervised machine learning that culminated in a Streamlit app. This project has helped me continue to grow my data science skill set by applying concepts from previous projects such as having an interactive UI and plotting visualizations to a project that is on a larger scale. I've enjoyed the exploratory data science work as I refined my code.
