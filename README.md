# Jennings-Data-Science-Portfolio

The purpose of this repository is to store my past and present projects from my Data Science classes at Notre Dame. 
My future projects will be organized in folders based on what type of skills and data are used. 

My current project is designing an interactive app in streamlit for users to engage with data in ways that are interesting and meaningful.
